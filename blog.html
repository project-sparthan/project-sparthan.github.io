Taking time to plan is crucial when going into manufacturing, as mistakes are easily more expensive and more time consuming than during the Research and Development phase.

            <p class="lead">
                  Last week's physical brainstorming helped us refine the ideas we had for building the exoskeleton. Now it's time to get the pieces together and start visualizing our ideas. Building a low resolution prototype of what we hope will be our final project is a great way to start a fast iteration cycle to understand possible problems and challenges.
               </p>  

               <h2> Sparthan Module  </h2>

               <img src="images/blog/sparthan.jpg" alt="V.0.0">

               <p class="lead">
                  <br>
                     Finally having access to one of the developer previews of the sparthan module is very intriguing. The module is very compact and can be programmed using both MicroPython and the Arduino IDE. <br>
                     For our application we are only going to use 4 of the 5 available modules, but we'll need to design the glove around the module dimensions to avoid having a bulky prototype.

                  <br>
                     We printed all the components of our low resolution prototype in a flexible 3D printable polymer (TPE). This material is stiffer than regular flexible filament while maintaining enough elasticity to wrap comfortably around the hand. <br>
                     The aesthetics of the prototype are very rough, but this allows us to experience the feel and weight of all the functional components. This step is very helpful in making final adjustments before starting the design process to make it aesthetically pleasing.

                  Prototyping can be a long and iterative process. Approaching iteration cycles with a "fail fast, learn fast" attitude can help significantly reduce the time needed to refine a product. This week we finalized the functional design for a low resolution prototype and we experienced how difficult it could be to combine good looks with function.

               <h1>Physical Brainstorming:</h1>

            <p class="lead">
                  After assessing the physical properties and limits of the 3D materials available to us, we decided to take our brainstorming to the next step, fabricating some of our ideas to better visualize their bio-mechanical behaviors.
               </p>  

               <h2> Prototype V.0.0 </h2>

               <img src="images/blog/V.BETA.png" alt="V.BETA">

               <p class="lead">
                  <br>
                  The very first iteration of physical brainstorming focused on finding a way to fix the glove to the hand, by using adjustable rings that could be connected to flexible joints on the top of the finger. However, the length of the joints when the finger bends is not fixed and this caused the rings to slide on the user's finger, causing discomfort, partially caused by the hard plastic used for the rings.
                  <br>
               </p>              

               <h2> Prototype V.0.1 </h2>

               <img src="images/blog/V.0.0.png" alt="V.0.0">

               <p class="lead">
                  <br>
                  The second version of our physical brainstorming looked very rough, basically just a flexible curl of soft 3D printed plastic that wrapped around the finger. A string was placed on the upper surface and when pulled it could straighten the finger, while the natural elasticity of the plastic provided grip strength. We noticed that we needed a way to provide additional grip strength and we decided to add an elastic band that run alongside the bottom of the finger. Zipties were added to have a quick and easy way to asses the best force application points along the axis of the finger
                  <br>
               </p>
               
                  
               <h2> Prototype V.0.2 </h2>

               <img src="images/blog/V.0.1.png" alt="V.0.1">

               <p class="lead">
                  <br>
                  After noticing how freedom of movement in the hand was limited by this prototype we decided to redesign the attachment points to the fingers, ditching the flexible strip, which limited movement. We designed parametric CAD models of rings that could be adjusted to fit the different diameters along the fingers and presented routing holes at the top for the string tendon to pass through.
                  <br>
               </p>
               
               <h2> Prototype V.0.3 </h2>

               <img src="images/blog/V.0.2.png" alt="V.0.2">

               <p class="lead">
                  <br>
                  Using only 2 attachment rings proved to be quite uncomfortable due to the rubbing of the string on the knuckles. We added a third ring and added once again the rubber band on the bottom to provide the resting grip strength needed to grip objects firmly.
                  <br>
               </p>
                  
               </p>

               <h2>Reflections and challenges:</h2>
               <p class="lead">

                  The physical brainstorming proved to be beneficial to our design process, helping us visualize complex bio-mechanical scenarios in a more efficient way. Last week's exploration of flexible 3D printing materials helped in sizing accurately our initial prototypes, saving time that could be used for brainstorming better mechanical solutions.
                  <br>
                  Using an elastic material to provide the grip strength necessary could solve the issue of having a bulky object around the hand, but is much more prone to fatigue and possible rupture. Finding better ways to solve this issue will be the main focus of next week prototyping session.
